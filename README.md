The Weather App is a simple web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to search for real-time weather information of any city. It fetches weather data from an external API and displays details like temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and wind speed. The app has a clean and responsive design, making it accessible on both desktop and mobile devices. Users can input a city name, and the app dynamically updates the weather information using JavaScript to fetch data and display it in real-time.
